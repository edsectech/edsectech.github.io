</h2>K12 Technology departments are lean and budgets are tight. Few
districts have a security professional, much less a team, and most
vendors have priced themselves out of the EDU space. Double that with
1:1 student device programs and an explosion of cloud-based services,
and the dumpster is primed for a fire. This page is a humble attempt at
compiling some lessons learned from trial and error, research, and
collaboration with peers. I'm still early in the security journey, so I
hope for this page to improve as my posture improves. 
This site is perpetually under construction as I hopefully continue to add low-cost (usually free) solutions for hardening and
protecting systems. To start, the site is dealing primarily with
phishing and mail-based attack vectors. As time goes on, I hope to
start documenting device hardening, user policies, administrative
controls, as well as documenting some adventures with open source SIEM and Phishing platforms.
<br>
<br>
I'm also taking the opportunity to work on my CSS game. So - if headers or footers are floating in weird ways... oops. <br>
<br>
<br>
Why start with mail-based attack vectors?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">On the average week in my environment:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>5.5% of email messages that flow through my mail system are
flagged as
Phishing. This does not include ones that make it past our mail
system's baked-in threat management. </li>
  <li>14% of account logins are blocked because they are coming from
outside of North America</li>
</ul>
